# vegetation-feature-extraction-

This repository includes U-Net implementation for multi-spectral images in CNTK environment. 

#arvi.py

ARVI vegetation index is used in U-Net as a single channel.

#egx.py

EGX vegetation index is used in U-Net as a single channel.

#ndvi.py

NDVI vegetation index is used in U-Net as a single channel.

#pca1.py

PCA is applied on the RGB images and only the first components is used in U-Net as a single channel.

#rgb.py

Original code. RGB image set is used as an input to U-Net architecture.
